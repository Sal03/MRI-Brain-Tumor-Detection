# MRI-Brain-Tumor-Detection

### The brain is a central organ in the human body, and minor damage to this organ could affect the correct functioning of the human body. Brain tumors can lead to irreversible and dysfunctional damage to patients, including memory and vision loss. For these reasons, medical studies have, for a long time, focused on the study of the brain and its diseases, including brain tumors. In this project I have created a model using sklearn on brain tumor dataset.
